# üéâ Router Logger - Setup Complete!

## ‚úÖ What's Been Built

You now have a **production-ready RUT200 router logging system** with:

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database with optimized schema
- ‚úÖ **RMS API Integration** - Pulls data from Teltonika RMS automatically
- ‚úÖ HTTPS endpoint for router push data
- ‚úÖ MQTT support (optional)
- ‚úÖ Cell tower geolocation (OpenCellID integration)
- ‚úÖ RESTful API with stats and filtering
- ‚úÖ **Deployed on Railway** ‚ú®

### Frontend (React)
- ‚úÖ Router list with real-time status
- ‚úÖ Interactive charts (data usage, signal quality, uptime, WiFi clients)
- ‚úÖ Date range filtering
- ‚úÖ CSV/PDF export functionality
- ‚úÖ Ready to deploy

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ Complete setup guides
- ‚úÖ RMS API integration guide
- ‚úÖ RMS configuration guide for router push
- ‚úÖ MQTT setup guide
- ‚úÖ **Code on GitHub**: https://github.com/atoates/router_logger.git

## üöÄ Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. Backend deployed to Railway
2. PostgreSQL database configured
3. RMS API token configured
4. Code pushed to GitHub
5. RMS sync running (pulls data every 15 minutes)

### üîÑ Next Steps

#### Step 1: Enable Public Access to Backend (Optional)
Your backend is running but may not have a public URL yet. To enable:

1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.com/project/7b2bc4f9-a4be-467d-9ea5-69539500e818
2. Click on `routerlogger` service
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Scroll to **Networking**
5. Click **Generate Domain**
6. Copy the URL (something like `routerlogger-production.up.railway.app`)

#### Step 2: Test RMS Integration

Once you have the URL, test it:

```bash
# Check RMS status
curl https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app/api/rms/status

# Manually trigger sync
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app/api/rms/sync

# Check routers
curl https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app/api/routers
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd /Users/ato/VS\ Code/RouterLogger/frontend

# Create .env file
echo "REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app" > .env

# Link to Railway (create new service)
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

Then generate a domain for the frontend in Railway dashboard.

#### Step 4: Verify Data is Flowing

1. Open your frontend URL
2. You should see routers from RMS appearing
3. Click on a router to see details
4. Charts should populate with data

## üìä How It Works Now

### RMS API Integration (Active)
- **Every 15 minutes**, the backend:
  1. Calls RMS API to get all your devices
  2. Fetches monitoring data (cellular, WiFi, network)
  3. Stores data in PostgreSQL
  4. Data appears in dashboard

### Optional: Router Push
You can also configure routers to push data directly:
- See `docs/RMS-CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md`
- Both methods can work together

## üîß Configuration Reference

### Environment Variables (Backend - Already Set)
```env
DATABASE_URL=<from Railway PostgreSQL>
RMS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your token - already set>
RMS_SYNC_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Environment Variables (Frontend - To Set)
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app
```

## üéØ What You Can Do Now

### View Data from RMS
Once the frontend is deployed, you can:
- ‚úÖ See all routers from your RMS account
- ‚úÖ View real-time status (online/offline)
- ‚úÖ Monitor signal quality (RSRP, RSRQ, RSSI, SINR)
- ‚úÖ Track data usage over time
- ‚úÖ See WiFi connected clients
- ‚úÖ Export reports (CSV/PDF)
- ‚úÖ Filter by date range

### Manage via RMS
Continue using RMS for:
- ‚úÖ Device configuration
- ‚úÖ Firmware updates (FOTA)
- ‚úÖ Remote access
- ‚úÖ Grouping and organization

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Check if RMS sync is working
```bash
# Via Railway CLI
cd backend
railway logs | grep -i "rms sync"

# Look for:
# "Starting RMS sync..."
# "Fetched X devices from RMS"
# "RMS sync complete: X successful"
```

### Check database has data
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, open PostgreSQL
# Or use railway CLI to connect
railway connect Postgres

# Then query:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM routers;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM router_logs;
```

### Backend not responding
- Check Railway dashboard for service status
- Check logs for errors: `railway logs`
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set
- Verify RMS_ACCESS_TOKEN is set
